## What is this event about?

We invite you to join us for a two-day introductory event about Wikidata, a free and open knowledge base. Our aim is to bring together members from the Göttingen Campus and the Wikidata community to pilot projects that improve re-use from and contributions to Wikidata.


## How does it work?

This event is organised as a do-a-thon. After a brief introduction into Wikidata, we will pitch ideas for new projects and challenges. You are free to join any team to get a project started. 

We'll be using this GitHub repository for documenting and discussing ideas before, during, and after the event, both for remote participants and everyone else who is interested. 

- Share a project for others to get engaged with, or a challenge using the issue tracker
- Find a project or challenge to get engaged with using the issue tracker

Anyone can propose ideas and is invited to contirbute, with or without coding or prior Wikidata experiences! 

## What is a do-a-thon?

Sparc Open has created a great summary of what a do-a-thon is about:

- <https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon/blob/master/.github/contributing.md>

In summary, do-a-thons have three main goals:

1. Focus on doing, rather than just hacking.

2. Explore problems deeply and thoughtfully.

3. Encourage collaboration across skillsets. Build solutions together.
